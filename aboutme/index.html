    <h2>Tyler Burke</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Tyler Burke. I am from Ashton, Idaho which is just about 30 minutes north of here. Most of my time right now 
        is spent at school or work. I am a computer science major. What I love most about BYU Idaho is the environment. At this point,
        I'd be suprised to not see a guy flirting with a girl that he probably bumped shoulders with in the hall.</p>
    <p>During my free time, I enjoy doing a lot of things outdoors. Idaho is the perfect place to live to have hobbies that are 
        outdoors too which is another reason why I love it here. Practically every weekend, you will either find me in a mountain or a 
        river. Hiking and kayaking are my favorite outdoor activities! This weekend, I am going on one of my favorite hikes which is 
        famous in the area called Table Rock. It is up in the Tetons, and this hike in particular gives the best view of the peaks.
    </p>
