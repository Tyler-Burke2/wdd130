      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The purpose of the home page will be to quickly catch the attention of whoever joins the website by having a short, powerful message that introduces the purpose of the website. It will then be followed by pictures and explanations of what to expect from the site along with where on the site they can go to get answers to their questions.

      </ul>
      <h3>Brands</h3>
      <p>
        What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site? 
        The purpose of people coming to this site will be to help them to decide what shoe would be best for them. The activities that will be completed on this site are gaining a better knowledge of what makes one shoe better than another, and also to help them develop an informed opinion about which shoes they should buy. They will also be able to compare the prices of shoes from one brand to another in order to help them know which shoes fit into their price range.

        What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers? 
        What I will have to do in order to gain more information in order to make the site more effective is to do my own research about running shoes so that I can give more accurate descriptions of the shoes and the benefits to each one. This will require that I take time to learn all the definitions and find ways to simplify them so that others donâ€™t have to be confused about the terms. Because there are so many different pairs of running shoes from many different brands, I will also need to narrow down what I decide to use on the site. I will do this by looking at what are currently the most popular shoes as well as what I have enjoyed the most.

        Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?
        People will come to my site instead of others because it will be more simple and easy to understand when compared to other similar websites. A problem with online stores is that nothing is simplified or defined so it becomes difficult for people to know what is good about the product outside of its appearance from the pictures that are displayed. I plan to have things laid out in a similar way to online stores minus the shopping part, but also with a more quick and easy to understand interface with things being as simple as possible.

      </ul>
      <h3>Tech</h3>
      <p>
        Why will people come to your site? 
        People will visit my website in order to obtain information regarding running shoe brands and the pros and cons of each one. By doing so, people can become more formally educated as to their needs when it comes to what shoes to buy for athletic activities. I used to be big into running and one thing that was always hard for me was knowing the differences between different shoes and what would work the best for me, but as I began to do my own research, I began to learn about the different tech in shoes and what they are able to do in order to assist in runs.
        
        What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them? 
        This site will answer any questions regarding what all of the technology that large scale running shoe brands put into their shoes. It can be super confusing for most people to understand the big terms that are used to describe things that are in shoes such as react foam or carbon fiber plate, so I plan to put explain those terms in simple English so that they can make more sense to a new or returning runner. I also want to list out for people what shoes have which pieces of running tech in them to answer the question of which shoes have what technology. This will help to make the decision as to which shoes to buy much easier than it would be otherwise.
