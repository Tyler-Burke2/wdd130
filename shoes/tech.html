        <h2>Cushioning (React Foam)</h2>
        <p>Nike React foam is designed to provide exceptional cushioning and energy return, making it ideal for running and other high-impact activities. It is 11% softer and offers 13% more energy return compared to previous Nike cushioning technologies. Additionally, Nike React foam is lightweight and durable, ensuring long-lasting comfort and performance</p>

        <h2>Sole (Carbon Fiber Plate)</h2>
        <p>A carbon fiber plate in running shoes enhances propulsion by providing a spring-like effect, which helps runners achieve a more efficient stride. It also improves stability and reduces the amount of energy lost during toe-off, making each step feel more powerful. Additionally, the plate can help reduce fatigue by distributing pressure more evenly across the foot.</p>

        <img src="images/weight.jpg" alt="Weight Image">
        <h2>Weight</h2>
        <p>The weight of running shoes significantly impacts a runner's performance and energy expenditure. Lighter shoes can enhance speed and reduce fatigue by requiring less effort to lift with each stride. Conversely, heavier shoes can increase the aerobic demand of running, leading to slower times and greater fatigue.</p>
        <img src="images/width.jpg" alt="Width Image">
        <h2>Width</h2>
        <p>The toe box of running shoes provides space for the toes to spread naturally, which is crucial for balance and stability during a run. A well-designed toe box can help prevent blisters, calluses, and other foot injuries by reducing friction and pressure points. Additionally, it allows for better toe splay, which can enhance propulsion and overall running efficiency.</p>
